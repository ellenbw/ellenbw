Hello!

My name's Ellen and I live in Chicago. I'm a grad from the University of Virginia. I double majored in economics and statistics, with a concentration in econometrics. My academic career has led me to have experience in R, SQL, and Python for statistical testing, data visuaulization, machine learning, data wrangling, text analysis, and data science. Now, I'm a Data & Analytics consultant primarily working in the litigation space. My project work includes consulting for fintech companies, international banks, and pharmaceutical corporations.
