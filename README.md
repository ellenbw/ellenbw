Hello friends! :sun_with_face:

My name's Ellen and I'm a recent from the University of Virginia. I double majored in economics and statistics, with a concentration in econometrics. My academic career has led me to have experience in R and Python for statistical testing, data visuaulization, machine learning, data wrangling, text analysis, and data science. 

Really into the out-of-the-ordinary coding projects. Like the "bees knees" :honeybee: (i.e. _excellent quality_) of coding work - expanding coding into areas that aren't usually coded. Captivated by the intersection of coding + literature, history, government, etc. Let's use coding to webscrape Yelp to find the best deep dish pizza in Chicago & to investigate literature. The possibilities are endless, so let's explore together. :sunglasses:
