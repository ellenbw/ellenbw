Hello friends! :sun_with_face:

My name's Ellen and I'm a grad from the University of Virginia. I double majored in economics and statistics, with a concentration in econometrics. My academic career has led me to have experience in R, SQL, and Python for statistical testing, data visuaulization, machine learning, data wrangling, text analysis, and data science. Now, I'm a Data & Analytics consultant primarily working in the litigation space. My project work includes consulting for fintech companies, international banks, and pharmaceutical corporations. 

Really into the out-of-the-ordinary coding projects. Especially expanding coding into areas that aren't usually coded. Captivated by the intersection of coding + literature, coding + history, coding + music, etc. Let's use coding to webscrape Yelp to find the best deep dish pizza in Chicago & to investigate literature. The possibilities are endless, so let's explore together. :sunglasses:
